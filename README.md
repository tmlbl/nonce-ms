# nonce-ms
======================

An example node module implementing a nonce with milliseconds. To install:

`npm install nonce-ms`

To use:

````
var nonce = require('nonce-ms');

var newNonce = nonce();
````

You can also log a nonce to the command line by installing nonce-ms globally:

`sudo npm install -g nonce-ms`

`nonce-ms`

Though I don't know why you'd want to do that.
